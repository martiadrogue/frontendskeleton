# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github][link-project-home].


## Pull Requests

-   **[BEM][link-bem]** - Block Element Modifier helps you to achieve reusable
    components and code sharing in the front-end.

-   **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any
    other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

-   **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow
    [SemVer v2.0.0][link-semver]. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an
    option.

-   **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

-   **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing,
    send multiple pull requests.

-   **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull
    request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits
    while developing, please [squash them][link-git-scm-commits] before
    submitting.

**Happy coding**!
